# Learn with QR Code Generator

This project is designed to help students and beginner developers understand how QR codes work and how to generate them programmatically using Python.

## What You'll Learn
- How QR codes encode data and handle error correction
- How to use the `qrcode` and `PIL` libraries in Python
- How to save and customize QR code images
- How to structure a clean, modular Python project

## How It Works
1. Input text or URL
2. Encode using `qrcode` with customizable settings
3. Render and save the QR code as a PNG image

## Challenges Solved
- Handling different input types (text, URLs)
- Ensuring QR readability across devices
- Keeping the codebase simple and extensible for future upgrades

## Resources
- [`qrcode` library documentation](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/)
- [QR Code standards and structure](https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/)
- [PIL (Python Imaging Library)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Why It Matters
QR codes are everywhereâ€”from robotics competitions to event check-ins. This project gives you a practical tool and a foundation for integrating QR logic into larger systems.
